# AIfA Telescope Gallery

Welcome everyone to the AIfA telescope gallery. This is a place where we share exciting results from observations with the 50cm rooftop telescope of the Argelander Institute for Astronomy (AIfA) in Bonn.
If you also have some exciting results to show, just contact us to collaborate in this Github. 

## How it works

In this repository you find a folder called *card_template*. In this folder is everything you need to create your own card on the website. You should try to upload two versions of your image(s). 
One is just the thumbnail, which does not need to be large. Actually it should not be large. Try to keep this image under 100kB and for sure less than 1000 pixels wide. Also upload the full sized version 
of your image, which will be shown if a visitor of the website clicks on the image. All you need to do now is fill out the cards template in the HTML. Give the file paths to your images **with respect to index.html**. 
It would be nice if you would write something about the image in the content div; like technical details or interesting side notes. If you are happy with your card, the last step is going into the index.html and include your cards at the indicated position.
You can just copy paste one of the already existing div's, which imports a card. You only need to change the filepath to your cards html. There is no automatic sorting going on currently, so it would be nice if you could insert your card at the right position, such that 
everything is in chronological order. 

### Thank you for sharing your results!
